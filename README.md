Hello All! I’m John. I am analyst with multinational and robust leadership capabilities built over 22 years’ serving as a military intelligence officer, data analyst, consultant, trainer, and interoperable leader. Results driven within austere and peacetime environments facilitating descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive data analysis and data storytelling that is vital to decision making for United States Department of Defense missions. Progressive, adaptive, and value-based student of life and learning.

My interests are in learning and experimenting with the things I learn. Some things I am learning aside from data science and machine learning include wood working as a hobby, growing and maintaining bonsai plants. I enjoy a friendly round of golf. I like to relax in my kayak while casting a line to see what will bite.

I’m not looking to collaborate on anything specific; however, if you see ways to improve on any code I post, please let me know. I welcome all constructive comments. If there is a more efficient way to construct some code, teach me.

You can find me on LinkedIn linkedin.com/in/john-e-burris/ or on Medium <medium.com/@johnnyb0404>. I do not write for monetary gain. I write because it helps me sort and recall information I have recently learned.
